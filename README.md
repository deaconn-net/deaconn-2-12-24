This is [Deaconn's](https://deaconn.net/) rebuilt website which uses the T3 stack, [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/), and is completely **open source**! This stack comes with TypeScript, Next.js, React, tRPC, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS.

## Source Code As Of 2-12-24
This is [Deaconn's website](https://deaconn.net) as of *Feburary 12th, 2024*. We've decided to keep the current website closed-source due to the future implementations of services, payment gateways, and more.

## Features
* Login through GitHub, Google, or Discord.
* Role-based permissions.
* A simple admin panel.
* Full Markdown support with code highlighting for content fields.
* A blog system.
* A service system which will eventually support transactions and more in the future.
* A user request system.
* User profiles including fields such as **About Me** and more.
* The ability for users to showcase their own projects, experiences, and skills which then can act as a personalized portfolio!
* A Sitemap that generates URLs for static and dynamic content that should come up on search engines.

**Note** - We are adding additional features quite often since the website is actively under development.
